Retired in '99 due to injury. Last grade was B. One of UCSC's pioneers. Squash is appealing because of its discipline and commitment in order to excel in it. A productive way of keeping fit in a short space of time.",

From the formation years of UCSC and my subsequent appointment as Disciplinary Chairman, till now I am glad to announce that todate no disciplinary action has been taken against any club members. I am proud of this record not because of the existence of this post but proud of our fellow members self-discipline which made this post seem rather unnecessary. '..... ...CARING for our fellow members in every aspect of our game and life is the best discipline I hope we can achieve .............'",

    desc: "I was first married to badminton for many years in the 80s and then in recent years found myself having an affair with squash after I stumbled into this UCSC website. Keeping this affair going is no easy task as it demands total dedication and requires plenty of sacrifices. Occasionally things do get out of hand and I will suffer from aches all over my body when that happens. On the positive side my waistline has been shrinking since the affair started. That's why this whole affair thing is so exciting to me in the first place. Come on down and join us to - 'SHED YEARS FROM YOUR AGE AND ADD YEARS TO YOUR LIFE'.",

    desc: "I first started playing squash when I was around 12 years of age and have never stopped since then! I love the game and I love UCSC simply because it values a good attitude, sportsmanship and having fun over the pressure to win all of the time. Of course, winning is always a bonus but it's not the focus. With a relaxed, friendly atmosphere at the club you’ll soon find that your team mates and members become like your family…..I did. I’m honoured to be included as an advisor in the UCSC committee and look forward to contributing to the growth of this already well established club. Happy squashing!",

Last of my tennis buddies introduced me to squash on the day we turned up to play tennis and it rained heavily. I felt  Squash to be weatherproof, more physical and also gives a chance to settle scores with your opponent locked in the court :-). I continued to play more often and Squash has been my main sport since 2014. UCSC is an inclusive club with a large pool of players. That makes it an ideal place to enjoy the sport and build camaraderie.",

    desc: "I started playing squash in 2000, to replace my daily run on the treadmill. I was introduced to UCSC in 2004. As a beginner, UCSC has shown me that it is really a 'Squash4All' club. Not only do I get to play some games at Singapore Polytechnic, I get to play with similar level players as well. Of course the friendly environment will make any new member feel welcome. Hence when I was approached by the Committee to be the Treasurer, I had absolutely no reasons to turn them down. Hopefully with the efforts that the Committee puts in, UCSC will scale new heights on the squash scene.",

I introduced the game to my boys 3 years ago and was delighted when I chanced upon the UCSC group at Yio Chu Kang in 2006. We’ve been playing regularly ever since, made many new friends and are extremely glad to be a part of this fantastic family.",

As a result of such interaction the idea of forming UCSC was started and eventually bore fruit. My next commitment to the game is to see my two sons Marcus and Hansel playing a high level of squash and building UCSC into the most popular squash club in Singapore.",
